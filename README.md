# Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals
**Announcements**

No class on Mon 6 Jan and Fri 10 Jan 2020 (e-learning week). Please use the time to complete your outstanding assignments and update the documentation on your website. I will be available for consultation during the week (drop me an email).

**Module Aims**

In this elective, students are introduced to design thinking concepts, which they will use to design some functional prototypes to meet certain user requirements. Fundamental digital fabrication skills and technologies such as computer-aided design, 2D and 3D modelling, mechanical & electronic design and programming skills are developed through a range of hands-on real world activities. Project management, web and version control techniques, which are important for project development, will also be imparted to students.

**Teachng Methods**

The module incorporates active and experiential learning *(CDIO Standard 8)* through a combination of tutorials, e-learning and practical workshop sessions. To help the students better understand the basic essential concepts, demonstrations will also be conducted in the lab/workshop *(CDIO Standard 6)*. Audio visual media, hardware and various teaching aids will be used in the course delivery for effective learning. 

Students have to demonstrate their ability to work individually and in groups to encourage teamwork, personal and interpersonal communication skills. 

**Methods of Assessment**

Assessment will be based on exercises and projects through three in-course assessments (ICA) as follows:

|S/No |Item |Description |Weightage |
|-----|-----|------------|----------|
| 1	|CA1 |Documentation/Website	|20% |
| 2	|CA2 |Fablab (Digital Fabrication) Skills	|40% |
| 3	|CA3 |Summative Project	|40% |
